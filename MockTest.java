1) Abstraction is hiding the implementation and showing the functionality of the object.
Abstraction can be achieved in 2ways
1)Abstract Classes.
2)Interfaces. 

1)Abstract Classes: Abstract key is used to make Abstract Classes.
2)Interfaces: implements key is used to inherit the properties of the parent class to child class.

Encapsulation: Whereas ,the wrapping up of the data of the Object is called encapsulation.
Capsule is real time example for encapsulation.Because it contains many medicines inside it.And Java Bean is a example for fully encapsulated class.


3)Inheritance : The process of aquiring all the properties from parent class is Called Inheritance.
There are 5types of Inheritance and one of them is Multiple Inheritance.
Multiple Inheritance is group of Single,Multilevel and Heirarchical Inheritance.Where Parent properties are acquired by Child class.
Multiple Inheritance gives rise to ambiguity where the problem occurs while Inheriting the properties of Parent Class.Hence it is not used supported nowadays.
It can be achieved by using Interfaces.

7)equals() : This method compares the address of an 2 respective objects where (==) compares the values of 2objects.

9)private : It is a keyword where object can be accessed within the class but not outside the class or package.It can be accessed only
			if getters and setters methods are used.
  protected : It is a keword used in declaration of fields which cannot be accessed outside class or package.
  public : The objects can be accessed within class,outside the class and also anywhere outside the package.
  
10)Wrapper Class : It is a process of converting Primitive in Non-Primitive objects.There are 2types ;
1)Autoboxing : It is a process of converting Primitive into Objects.
2)Unboxing : It is a process of converting Non-primitive to Primitive objects.


12)Heap Memory : It is a memory location where all the objects are stored.
 Stack Memory : It is a location where methods are being stored.
 

15)final : It is a keyword which is used to declare variables,methods and classes of an object.It is used where we cannot change the 
			values of a object.It is fixed and cannot change the implementation of the object.
static is also keyword which is used in implementation of an methods,variables and class.The main method should must and should contains
static keyword because the programs starts executing from the main method.static variables can be accessed using class name or reference 
of an object directly.

8)We can create constatnts in Java by using enum class.If we declare constants in enum we cannot change the values of particular constants
in any class when we try to call or invoke it.
